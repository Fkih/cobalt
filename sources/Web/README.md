### How to use ?

**Don't** use these scripts if you just want to use the framework.
Use the concatened version in [../../distribution/web](../../distribution/web) instead.
You can find the minified version too.

### How does it work ?

Javascript files are split into a common file for all OSes and an adapter file for each platform.
There is no all-in-one-with-autodection version yet but we think about it :)
